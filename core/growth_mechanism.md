# DataFlow Arbitrage — Growth Mechanism

## 1. Passive Adoption Vector

The system grows through:
- code reuse
- architectural referencing
- pattern extraction

Growth is initiated by developers,
not by marketing actions.

## 2. Fork-First Dynamics

The core is designed to be forked early,
modified locally,
and embedded silently into larger systems.

Forking is treated as a success signal,
not a loss of control.

## 3. Dependency-Free Entry

No mandatory setup.
No configuration requirements.
No onboarding flow.

This reduces friction to near zero.

## 4. Invisible Value Accumulation

Most adopters will not attribute usage.
This is intentional.

Value propagates through outputs,
not through branding.

## 5. Long-Term Growth Pattern

As data complexity increases globally,
systems that reduce interpretation friction
become unavoidable infrastructure.

The system positions itself in that path.
