# DataFlow Arbitrage — Optional Automation Layer

## 1. Automation Philosophy

Automation is used to preserve structure,
not to enforce execution.

The system remains functional
without active automation.

## 2. Zero-Infrastructure Approach

Automation relies exclusively on:
- repository structure
- scheduled public workflows
- version-controlled analysis artifacts

No external servers.
No persistent services.
No paid resources.

## 3. Trigger Mechanisms

Automation can be triggered by:
- repository updates
- scheduled intervals
- external forks or references

All triggers remain optional.

## 4. Output Artifacts

Automated processes may produce:
- normalized datasets
- anomaly snapshots
- divergence reports

Artifacts are stored as versioned files.

## 5. Failure Tolerance

If automation stops,
the system degrades gracefully
without loss of core value.
