# DataFlow Arbitrage — Income Capture Layer

## 1. Principle

Income is not extracted from users,
but from secondary value generated by system usage.

The core remains open and neutral.

## 2. Capture Surfaces

Potential income surfaces include:
- aggregated anomaly datasets
- structured discrepancy indexes
- time-based divergence metrics
- reusable analytical signatures

These surfaces emerge naturally
as a result of widespread usage.

## 3. Separation of Concerns

Income capture mechanisms are:
- optional
- external to the core
- non-intrusive

The analytical system functions
regardless of monetization.

## 4. Passive Alignment

Income generation does not require:
- onboarding users
- maintaining customer relationships
- active promotion

Monetization aligns with system scale,
not with human effort.

## 5. Ethical and Legal Boundary

All income surfaces rely exclusively
on publicly available information
and derivative analysis.

No private data.
No exclusive access.
No manipulation.
