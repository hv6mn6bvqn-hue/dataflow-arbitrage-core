# DataFlow Arbitrage — Proof of Signal

## Objective

Demonstrate the existence of detectable discrepancies
between multiple public data sources
describing the same real-world parameter.

## Chosen Parameter (Example)

Parameter:
Publicly reported exchange rate value.

Rationale:
The same metric is published simultaneously
by multiple independent sources,
yet minor timing and formatting differences exist.

## Data Sources (Public)

Source A:
Official public financial data feed.

Source B:
Independent aggregated market data source.

Both sources are:
- publicly accessible
- legally usable
- free of authentication requirements

## Observed Signal

Preliminary observation indicates:
- timing offset between updates
- rounding differences
- normalization inconsistencies

These discrepancies form a repeatable analytical signal.

## Significance

The signal itself has no intrinsic value.
Value emerges when:
- signals are aggregated
- patterns are tracked over time
- divergence frequency is analyzed

This document confirms that
DataFlow Arbitrage is practically observable.
