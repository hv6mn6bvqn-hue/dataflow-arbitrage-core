# Data Assetization Model

Definition:
Collected and processed data becomes an asset
when it can be reused, referenced, or integrated
without additional human effort.

Asset Forms:
- Structured datasets
- Historical time-series
- Normalized cross-source records
- Derived analytical signals

Value Drivers:
- Data cleanliness
- Update frequency
- Consistent structure
- Longitudinal depth

Distribution Logic:
- Open access by default
- Machine-readable formats
- Clear schema definitions
- Attribution-preserving reuse

Self-Growth Mechanism:
As more systems rely on the data format,
the cost of replacement increases and value compounds.
